        <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original
            meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant 
            matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternate definition of 
            the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude 
            foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include 
            savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
