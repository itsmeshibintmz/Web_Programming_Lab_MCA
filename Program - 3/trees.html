        <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and 
            leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only 
            wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified 
            height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. 
            Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently 
            evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees 
            tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 
            370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.
