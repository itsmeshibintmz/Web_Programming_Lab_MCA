        <p>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary
            after flowering. Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) 
            disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of
            humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group
            and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a 
            source of food.[1] Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's 
            agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive 
            cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>
