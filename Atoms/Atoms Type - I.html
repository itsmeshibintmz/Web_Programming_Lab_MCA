        <p>Atoms consist of three basic particles: <b>protons, electrons, and nuetrons. <br></b>
        The nucleus(center) of the atom contains the protons (positively charged) and electrons (no charge). <br>
        The outermost regions of the atom are called electron shells and contain the electrons (no charge). <br>
        Atoms have different properties based on the arrangement and number of their basic particles. <br></p>
        The hydrogen atom (H) contains only one proton, one electron, and no nuetrons. This can be determined using the atomic number and the mass number of the element (see the concept on atomic numbers and <br> mass numbers). <br>

        <h3>ATOMIC MASS</h3>
        Protons and nuetrons have approximately the same mass, about <i>1.67 x 10<sup>-24</sup>grams.</i>
